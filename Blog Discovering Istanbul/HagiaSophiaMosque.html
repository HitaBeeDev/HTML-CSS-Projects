            <h2>Hagia Sophia Mosque (Turkish: Ayasofya Camii)</h2>
            <h5>A historic landmark located in Istanbul, Turkey.
            </h5>
            <p>Welcome to Hagia Sophia, one of the most magnificent architectural wonders in the world! Located in Istanbul, Turkey, this iconic building has a rich history that dates back to the 6th century.
<br>
              Built as a Christian church by Emperor Justinian I in 537 AD, Hagia Sophia has undergone many transformations over the years. It was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople in 1453 and was later turned into a museum in 1935. In 2020, it was once again converted into a mosque.
              <br>

The interior is adorned with stunning mosaics and intricate artwork that reflect the building's Christian and Islamic heritage.
              <br>
              One of the most impressive features of Hagia Sophia is the mesmerizing play of light that filters through the windows and illuminates the interior. The natural light that floods the space changes throughout the day, creating a unique and unforgettable experience for visitors.
              <br>
              In addition to its architectural and historical significance, Hagia Sophia is also a symbol of cultural and religious diversity. Its transformation from a Christian church to a mosque and later into a museum and mosque again is a testament to the many influences that have shaped Istanbul's rich cultural heritage.
